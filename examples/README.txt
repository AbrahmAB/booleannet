This folder contains the following case studies:

	- aba : Abcisic Acid Signaling
	- immune: Bordetella Bronchiseptica simulation 
	- LGL: T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia simulation

Each folder may contain multiple files. The files of main 
interest are the ones ending in -sim.py and in -plot.py.

The former was used to generate the data, the latter is used 
to plot it. Each folder already includes data for a long run
so you can run the ploting program right away and it should 
produce the figure published in the paper.
