Below we document the class and method signatures.

===Engine Creation===

{{{
engine = boolean.Engine( mode='sync', text=text )
#
# mode may be: sync, async or lpde corresponding to
# synchronous, asycnhronous and linear piece wise differential equations
}}}

===State Initialization===

{{{

def miss_func( node ):
    return True

engine.initialize( miss_func=miss_func, default=dict(A=True) )

#
# both the miss_func, and default parameters are optional
# the miss_func, if present will be called for every node that was not 
# initialized in the main body of the text input
#
# the default parameter, if present will be used to override all values
# that may be set beforehand, thus node A above will alwyas have
# the value True, no matter what the text or the miss_func may be set it to
#
}}}

===State Modifications===

{{{
from boolean import util
text = util.modify_states(text=text, turnon=["A", "B"], turnoff=["C", "D"])

#
# a convenience function that modifies the input rules it
# takes the rules as text and turns on or off nodes in it
# it sets the nodes to True (or False) and comments out updating
# rules for each of them
#
