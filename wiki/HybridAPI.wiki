#summary Using the library in a hybrid mode.

= Introduction =

The hybrid model models the booelan rules via _linear piecewise differential equations_. Practically
this means that a rule written as:

{{{ A = B and C }}}

will be intepreted as a differential equation of the form:

{{{ dA/dt = (( conc(B) > threshold(B)) and (conc(C) > threshold(C)) - decay(A) * conc(A) }}}

where every node in the system will be characterize by three parameters, the _concentration_, 
the _threshold_ and the _decay_.
