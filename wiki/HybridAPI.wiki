#summary Using the library in a hybrid mode.

= Introduction =

The hybrid model models the booelan rules via _linear piecewise differential equations_. 
Every node in the system will have three continous variables associated with it a _concentration_, 
a _threshold_ and a _decay_. Each node is considered ON when its concentration is greater than 
the threshold. Practically this means that a rule written as:

{{{ A = B and C }}}

will be solved as a differential equation of the form:

{{{ dA/dt = (( conc(B) > threshold(B)) and (conc(C) > threshold(C)) - decay(A) * conc(A) }}}

This leads to the following dynamics for each node:
  
  * when the boolean term is `True` the equation is of the form `dA/dt = 1 - decay * A
  * when the boolean term is `False` the equation is of the form `dA/dt = -decay * A

Thus, in time we may have either an exponential type increase or an exponential type decrease 
of the concentrations.
